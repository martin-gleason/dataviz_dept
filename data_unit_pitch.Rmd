# Executive Summary
  
* The department should invest staffing resources into a Data, Research, and Visualization unit.

* This unit would do the following:
  * Collect, clean, analyze, and present department data
  * Collaborate with stakeholders across the Juvenie Justice System
  * Provide information and insight to the entire department
  * Prepare the deparment to transition to [CFive's Supervisor](https://www.cfive.com/products/supervisor/)'s data collection and dashboards features
    * Work with the [Cook County Geographic Information Systems Department](https://www.cookcountyil.gov/agency/geographic-information-systems-gis-0) to create new, data driven tools.

## Data, Research, and Visualization Unit's Benefits

* Solves the *mission critical* need of evidenced-based practices within established financial restrictions

* Maximize the investment in *CFive Supervisor.*

* Efficiently gather, store, and transform  data into information and insight

* Allow the Department to tell its own data-driven stories to stakeholders
  
* Idenitfy and address concerns of equity across the department
  *  Racial, caseload, unit, division and section

# RChangin in Practices

* *CFive* will change how we collect data (forms)

* The department can redesign reports for
  * Readability
      * *Easy to read and digest*
    
  * Portability
      * *Shareable regardless of format*
    
  * Reproducible
      * *Reports can be rerun with new data for new insights*

# Example: AOIC Stats 

Consider the current AOIC report, presented in the following format:

```{r first_8, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}

first_eight <- head(June[ , 1:19])

first_eight %>% 
  kable( format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover", "responsive", "condensed "), 
                font_size = 14) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "720px", height = "425px")

``` 
---
## Example: AOIC Stats 
* The first of the eight columns contain the DCPO, SPO, and police district. 

* The next seven columns contain the PO's caseload data.

* The remaining columns are a combination of: 
  * Unit 
  * Division
  * Department
  * Calculated values, such as: 
    * Caseload totals
    * Averages across the department

---
# Issues with this format

* Storing and presenting AOIC data in this fashion limits additional investigation of the data. 

  * Multiple spreadsheets must be created and merged in order to do month-month comparisons. 

  * Compiling said spreadsheets increases the chances of errors:
      * Due to spelling mistakes
      * Accidentally deleting spreadsheet structure
      * Over-writing spreadsheets while saving them.
      
* Excel does not become a website or a slide presentation easily

# The Solution: Tidy Data
.center[![:scale 45%](imgs/tidy_data1.png)]

* Implementing [tidy data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) is a critical step in creating a data-driven department

* Tidy data is short hand for:
    * Columns are single variable
    * Rows are single observation
    * Each observational unit forms a table

# AOIC Revisited
```{r tidy, include=TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
  cal_55_2 %>% 
    tidy_up() %>% 
    kable(booktabs = TRUE, format = "html", caption = "GBO: September, 2018") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"), font_size = 18) %>%
  scroll_box(width = "720px", height = "425px")

```
---
## New Format: Pros and Cons

.pull-left[
### Cons
* It is difficult to read a 17-column<sup>1</sup> wide table
  *   Scroll bars on web versions make it tolerable
  *   Print versions requires changing layout or font size
  *   PDFs can allow for "zooming in" on particular rows and columns 
]
.pull-right[
### Pros
* Allows for computed variables (average, total number of POs) by the software
* Tidy format allows for faster selection and filtering of specific items
* Tidy data allows for faster, and easier, combinations of data sets
  * Combining OCJ and CTA Data
]
<br />
.footnote[1: The columns are: *`r names(cal_55_2 %>% tidy_up()) %>% as.vector()`*]
---
## New Format: Visualizations
* *Tidy format is built to be analyzed, not presented as 17 column report*

```{r tidy_1, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}

lloyd <-  cal_55_2 %>% 
    tidy_up() 

cal_57 %>%
  tidy_up() %>%
  bind_rows(lloyd) %>% 
  select(`PO Name` = 1, High = `YASI HIGH`, Mod = `YASI MOD`, 
         Low = `YASI LOW`, Unclassified = `YASI UNCLASSIFIED`, SPO) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(Low, Mod, High, Unclassified)) %>%
  select(`PO Name`, SPO, High, Mod, Low, Unclassified, Total) %>%
  arrange(desc(High, SPO)) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, format = "html", caption = "GBO and Lawndale: September, 2018") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"), font_size = 18) 
```

* This table focuses only on case load and risk levels
  * It is the same data as the 17 column table

# Calculations 

.center[![](imgs/colbert-calculator.gif)]

</br>
Computed AOIC Stats (averages, medians, etc) can be computed and displayed through this format

---
## Caseload Numbers and Averages

```{r summary_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=TRUE}
lloyd <-  cal_55_2 %>% 
    tidy_up() 

cal_53_8_tidy <- cal_53_8 %>%
  tidy_up()

cal_75_tidy <- cal_75 %>%
  tidy_up()

cal_68_tidy <- cal_68 %>%
  tidy_up()

#turn into function

cal_55_60_63_tidy <- cal_55_60_63 %>%
  tidy_up()

cal_57 %>%
  tidy_up() %>%
  bind_rows(lloyd) %>% 
  bind_rows(cal_53_8_tidy) %>%
  bind_rows(cal_75_tidy) %>%
  bind_rows(cal_68_tidy) %>%
  bind_rows(cal_55_60_63_tidy) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(Total = sum(`YASI LOW`, `YASI MOD`, `YASI HIGH`, `YASI UNCLASSIFIED`)) %>%
  group_by(SPO) %>%
  summarize(`Total Officers` = n(),
            `Total Cases` = sum(Total),
             `Average Caseload` = ceiling(`Total Cases`/`Total Officers`)) %>%
  kable(booktabs = TRUE, format = "html", caption = "Case Totals: September, 2018") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("condensed", "hover"), font_size = 20)


```

* Unlike the Excel format, this document seperates data and computation

* Reusable code is more reliable, readable, and portable than an frequently updated spreadsheet

---
# Tidy Format and Graphs
.left-code[
* The tidy format is built for visualizations

* This work is done in `R` and R Markdown  

* Like Excel, these tools can create graphs

* Unlike Excel, these graphs are designed with reproducibility in mind
]
.right-plot[
```{r SI_VOP, include= TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, dpi = 300, fig.cap="Socials and VOPs in GBO and Lawndale"}

lloyd <-  cal_55_2 %>% 
    tidy_up() 

cal_57 %>%
  tidy_up() %>%
  bind_rows(lloyd) %>% 
  select(1, `Social Investigation` =`Social investigation`, 
         `VOP` = `VOP Filed`) %>%
  gather( c(`Social Investigation`, `VOP`), key = Social_VOP, 
          value = Totals) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = PO_Name, y = Totals, fill = `Social_VOP`)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, 
                              name = "Socials and VOP") +
  labs(title = "GBO and Lawndale, September 2018",
       x = "PO Name", y = "Client Totals") +
  coord_flip()
```

# Code, Tables, Graphs

* What makes this method superior to Excel is that the above code can be reused with a similar data set.

* With Excel, each month need to be recalculated from the specific sheet

* With `R`, the code can be reused with limited changes
  *  Additional data or transformations can be included easily

* `R` puts code, calculated values, and visiulzaitons in the same document
  * No need to cut and paste tables and charts

---
# Shiny
* An `R` server tool that makes web apps:
  * Dashboards, programmable reports, data entry and analysis tools

* Additional examples of how Shiny can be used can be found [here.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

* Additional resources required:
  * Server space
  * Web Server for internal websites

---
# GIS
* The Cook County Geographic Information Systems department is willing to work with the Department

* A Data, Research, and Visualization unit would be able to build internal capacity to utilize GIS tools to go beyond dashboards

* Even minimal partnerships would for the creation of regular programmable reports:
  * Unit level heat maps of risk levels
  * Neighborhood "hot spots."
  * Risk and success rates by commissioner district
  
---
# Data, Research, and Visualization Unit
* A unit with this mission will be able to
  * Create, modify, and generate standard reports for the department
  * Improve data integrity across the department
  * Provide insight into new areas for programming and policy

* Condensing existent department resources into a mission-focused unit will quickly create opportunities for ROI
